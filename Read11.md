# JupyterLab

JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.

## NumPy

NumPy is a core Python library every data science professional should be well acquainted with

`NumPy` stands for **Numerical Python** and is one of the most useful scientific libraries in Python programming. It provides support for large multidimensional array objects and various tools to work with them

NumPy arrays are called ndarray or N-dimensional arrays and they store elements of the same type and size. It is known for its high-performance and provides efficient storage and data operations as arrays grow in size.

different between python list and numpy arrays?

we use NumPy arrays that contain only homogeneous elements, i.e. elements having the same data type. This makes it more efficient at storing and manipulating the array. This difference becomes apparent when the array has a large number of elements, say thousands or millions. Also, with NumPy arrays, you can perform element-wise operations, something which is not possible using Python lists
