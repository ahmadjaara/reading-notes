# Permissions in drf

In DRF, permissions, along with authentication and throttling, are used to grant or deny access for different classes of users to different parts of an API.

Authentication and authorization work hand in hand. Authentication is always executed before authorization.

While authentication is the process of checking a user's identity (the user the request came from, the token that it was signed with), authorization is a process of checking if the request user has the necessary permissions for executing the request (are they a super user, are they the creators of the object).

## How permissions are determined

Permissions in REST framework are always defined as a list of permission classes.

Before running the main body of the view each permission in the list is checked. If any permission check fails, an exceptions.PermissionDenied or exceptions.NotAuthenticated exception will be raised, and the main body of the view will not run.

When the permission checks fail, either a "403 Forbidden" or a "401 Unauthorized" response will be returned, according to the following rules:

- The request was successfully authenticated, but permission was denied. — An HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned.
- The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does not use WWW-Authenticate headers. — An HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned.
- The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does use WWW-Authenticate headers. — An HTTP 401 Unauthorized response, with an appropriate WWW-Authenticate header will be returned.

## Object level permissions

REST framework permissions also support object-level permissioning. Object level permissions are used to determine if a user should be allowed to act on a particular object, which will typically be a model instance.

Object level permissions are run by REST framework's generic views when .get_object() is called. As with view level permissions, an exceptions.PermissionDenied exception will be raised if the user is not allowed to act on the given object.

If you're writing your own views and want to enforce object level permissions, or if you override the get_object method on a generic view, then you'll need to explicitly call the .check_object_permissions(request, obj) method on the view at the point at which you've retrieved the object.

This will either raise a PermissionDenied or NotAuthenticated exception, or simply return if the view has the appropriate permissions.

## DjangoModelPermissions

This permission class ties into Django's standard django.contrib.auth model permissions. This permission must only be applied to views that have a .queryset property or get_queryset() method. Authorization will only be granted if the user is authenticated and has the relevant model permissions assigned.

- POST requests require the user to have the add permission on the model.
- PUT and PATCH requests require the user to have the change permission on the model.
- DELETE requests require the user to have the delete permission on the model.

The default behaviour can also be overridden to support custom model permissions. For example, you might want to include a view model permission for GET requests.

To use custom model permissions, override DjangoModelPermissions and set the .perms_map property. Refer to the source code for details.
