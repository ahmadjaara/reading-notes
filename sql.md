# Sql database 

**Sql**: Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database

To creat a query first of all you will select the colomn that you want in the table by writing its name after a **SELECT** and if you want to have all the colomns in the table just write *  

Then in the FROM you write the name of table you want to extract the data from 

In real life data come in more than just one table so we used a **JOIN** command  with **ON** to connect these tables by a primary key which is a common column in these tables. 

Also we can make a condition to extract espical data by using **Where** command and using the comparing  tools such as equal not equal â€¦,or like % for string to match a especial order of string 

Also , we can order our data by using the **ORDER BY** command to order the data ascending asc
Or descending desc 

Also we can create our table using **CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS** and we can insert row or delete row or update row using special command **INSERT INTO with values**  / **DELETE FROM with condition** / **UPDATE with SET** to put the value and we use a condition here
