# linked list 
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list


# Types of Linked List

Following are the various types of linked list.

- Simple Linked List − Item navigation is forward only.

- Doubly Linked List − Items can be navigated forward and   backward.

- Circular Linked List − Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.

Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms concept of Linked List.

- Link − Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.

- Next − Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.

- LinkedList − A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.



## Basic Operations

Following are the basic operations supported by a list.

- Insertion − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.

- Deletion − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.

- Display − Displays the complete list.

- Search − Searches an element using the given key.

- Delete − Deletes an element using the given key.

# Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency

Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors:

- Running Time (also known as time efficiency / complexity)

    The amount of time a function needs to complete.

- Memory Space (also known as space efficiency / complexity)

    The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.
